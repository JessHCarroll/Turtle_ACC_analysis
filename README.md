Data and R Scripts for labelling Green turtle and Loggerhead turtle accelerometer data, calculating summary metrics (for different smoothing windows and sampling frequencies) and running a random forest model.

X.1-Label the accelerometer data with behavioural labels from BORIS

X.2-Create summary metrics and resample frequencies. This includes code adapted from (Clark, 2019; Clark et al., 2022). https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/120152, https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v701/p145-157/

X.3-Run random forest for each frequency and smoothing window.
